Two characters: Old Scientist and Baby Robot

The old scientist's name is Laith DeGarret, who created a robot before his unexpected death. The robot is noted to be
his last creation and possibly his greatest since it was able to preserve his previous memories but after waking
up in a foreign desert landscapes, the robot treks through these rough terrains in gaining understanding of his former
owner. In the end of the game, the robot ends up awakening as an AI for a spacecraft belonging to the old scientist's 
grandson, Leo.

The name of the robot that Laith made is TURON. 

There are possibly four landscapes presented for TURON. Each one will have a 3D desert plane used as the base of 
where the player is standing.

Since the theme for Chillennium is Role Reversal, we need to find a way to switch between levels for the player to see both sides
of the overall story.

To illustrate how the young robot overcomes these landscapes, there will be particle effects to demonstrate as rough winds and
harsh lighting from these deserts. These effects will collide with the baby robot as it tries to perserve against these conditions.

To make this more as an game, the player is given items halfway buried in each 3D desert plane, where each item represents
the connection between the old scientist and the baby robot. The player's job is to collect these items.

There will be four items in total and you must collect them all before the time limit is reached for each landscape. The time 
limit will be seven minutes for now.
